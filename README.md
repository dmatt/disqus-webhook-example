Hi Wistian!
===========

This is a starter Glitch project you can use to easily show a customer some code, and a live demo of said code.

## Here's how to use it:

1. Click `"Remix this"` in the header above. Like, right now!
2. Sign into Glitch if you're not signed in yet, so you can access your fancy new project later.
3. Click on the project title on the upper left. Rename it to describe the thing you're showing the customer. This will be in the URL, too.
4. Edit `index.html` (and other files if necessary) to be _your_ demo, instead of the template's demo.
5. Delete this section of the README, and edit the rest of `README.md` to explain the demo to your customer.

## When you're ready to share it:

* To invite your customer to **edit** the project, click `"Share"` on the upper left, and choose the `"Invite collaborators to edit"` option. 
* If you'd rather h**ave the customer make their own remix** of the project (like, if you intend to share the same project with other customers in the future), just share the URL of the page you're on right now (like `https://glitch.com/edit/#!/whatever-you-decided-to-call-it-in-step-3`).
