Hi Wistian!
===========

This is a starter Glitch project you can use to easily show a customer some code, and a live demo of said code.

Here's how to use it:

1. Click `"Remix this"` in the header above. Like, right now!
2. Sign into Glitch if you're not signed in yet, so you can access your fancy new project later.
3. Click on the project title on the upper left. Rename it to describe the thing you're showing the customer.
4. Edit `index.html` (and other files if necessary) to be _your_ demo, instead of the template's demo.
5. Delete this section of the README.
6. Edit the rest of `README.md` to explain the demo to your customer.
