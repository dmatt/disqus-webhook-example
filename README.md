Hi Wistian! üëã
=============

This is a starter Glitch project you can use to easily show a customer some code, and a [live demo](https://wistia-support-demo-template.glitch.me/) of said code.

### Here's how to use it:

1. Click `"Remix this"` in the header above. Like, right now!
2. Sign into Glitch if you're not signed in yet, so you can access your fancy new project later.
3. Click on the project title on the upper left. Rename it to describe the thing you're showing the customer. This will be in the URL, too.
4. Edit `index.html` (and other files if necessary) to be _your_ demo, instead of the template's demo.
5. Delete this section of `README.md` and edit the rest of it to explain the demo to your customer.

### When you're ready to share it, either...

* **Invite your customer to edit this project:**

  Click `"Share"` on the upper left, and choose the `"Invite collaborators to edit"` option. 
* **Have the customer make their own remix of the project:** 

  Do this if you intend to share the same project with other customers in the future. Just share the URL of the page you're on right now (like `https://glitch.com/edit/#!/whatever-you-decided-to-call-it-in-step-3`).

üö® Delete this line and the stuff above before sharing with the customer, so they'll just see your friendly customer-facing readme, below üö®
